# Transaction Fix Testing Guide

## Overview
This document describes the fix for the invalid transaction error and provides testing instructions to verify that withdrawals and transfers now work correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by improper database connection management:

1. **Singleton Connection Pattern**: The original `DBConnection` class used a singleton pattern that reused the same database connection across all requests.
2. **Transaction Isolation Issues**: When one request set `autoCommit=false` for a transaction, it affected all subsequent requests using the same connection.
3. **Resource Leaks**: PreparedStatements and ResultSets were not being closed properly in DAO methods.
4. **Connection State Conflicts**: Multiple concurrent requests could interfere with each other's transaction state.

## Changes Made

### 1. DBConnection.java
- **Before**: Used singleton pattern with single shared connection
- **After**: Returns a fresh connection for each request
- **Benefit**: Proper transaction isolation and no state interference between requests

### 2. AccountDAO.java
- Added proper resource cleanup in all methods
- All PreparedStatements, ResultSets, and Connections are now closed in finally blocks
- Methods affected:
  - `getBalance()`
  - `updateBalance()`
  - `accountExists()`
  - `getAccountIdByUserId()`
  - `getAccountByUserId()`
  - `createAccount()`

### 3. TransactionDAO.java
- Added ResultSet cleanup in transaction methods
- Added connection closing in finally blocks
- Methods affected:
  - `transferMoney()`
  - `withdrawMoney()`
  - `getTransactionHistory()`
  - `recordFailedTransaction()`

### 4. UserDAO.java
- Added proper resource cleanup in all methods
- Methods affected:
  - `registerUser()`
  - `loginUser()`
  - `emailExists()`

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure MySQL is running
2. Database `online_banking` is created and populated with the schema in `database/setup.sql`
3. Application is deployed to Tomcat

### Test Case 1: Withdrawal
**Objective**: Verify that withdrawals correctly deduct from account balance

**Steps**:
1. Login to the application with a test user
2. Note the current account balance on the dashboard
3. Navigate to the withdrawal page
4. Enter a valid amount (e.g., 100)
5. Submit the withdrawal

**Expected Results**:
- Success message: "Withdrawal successful! Amount: ₹100 has been withdrawn from your account."
- Account balance on dashboard should be reduced by the withdrawal amount
- Transaction appears in transaction history with status "SUCCESS"

**Test Withdrawal with Insufficient Balance**:
1. Attempt to withdraw an amount greater than the account balance
2. Expected: Error message "Insufficient balance! Available: ₹[balance]"
3. Balance should remain unchanged

### Test Case 2: Transfer
**Objective**: Verify that transfers correctly deduct from sender and credit to receiver

**Steps**:
1. Login with test user (Account ID: 1)
2. Note the current balance
3. Navigate to the transfer page
4. Enter receiver's account ID (e.g., 2)
5. Enter transfer amount (e.g., 50)
6. Submit the transfer

**Expected Results**:
- Success message: "Transfer successful! Amount: ₹50 transferred to Account #2"
- Sender's balance reduced by transfer amount
- Transaction appears in history with status "SUCCESS" and type "SENT"

**Verify Receiver's Balance**:
1. Login with the receiver account
2. Balance should be increased by the transfer amount
3. Transaction appears in history with type "RECEIVED"

**Test Transfer with Insufficient Balance**:
1. Attempt to transfer an amount greater than sender's balance
2. Expected: Error message "Insufficient balance! Available: ₹[balance]"
3. Both sender and receiver balances should remain unchanged

**Test Transfer to Invalid Account**:
1. Attempt to transfer to non-existing account ID (e.g., 99999)
2. Expected: Error message "Receiver account does not exist!"
3. Sender's balance should remain unchanged

### Test Case 3: Concurrent Transactions
**Objective**: Verify that multiple concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other

**Steps**:
1. Open two browser windows/tabs
2. Login with different users in each window
3. Simultaneously perform withdrawals/transfers in both windows

**Expected Results**:
- Both transactions complete successfully without interference
- Each account balance updated correctly
- No "invalid transaction" errors
- No deadlocks or connection timeout errors

### Test Case 4: Database Consistency
**Objective**: Verify that failed transactions are rolled back properly

**Steps**:
1. Create a scenario where transaction might fail (e.g., database temporarily unavailable)
2. Attempt a withdrawal or transfer
3. Check database directly

**Expected Results**:
- If transaction fails, balance remains unchanged
- No partial updates in the database
- Transaction history shows failed transaction (if applicable)

## Verification Queries

Execute these SQL queries to verify transaction integrity:

```sql
-- Check account balances
SELECT account_id, balance FROM accounts;

-- Check recent transactions
SELECT txn_id, sender_account, receiver_account, amount, status, transaction_type, txn_date 
FROM transactions 
ORDER BY txn_date DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Verify transaction sum matches balance changes
SELECT 
    a.account_id,
    a.balance,
    (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM transactions WHERE receiver_account = a.account_id AND status = 'SUCCESS') as received,
    (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM transactions WHERE sender_account = a.account_id AND status = 'SUCCESS' AND transaction_type != 'DEPOSIT') as sent
FROM accounts a;
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Working Correctly
- Withdrawals deduct correct amount from balance
- Transfers deduct from sender and credit to receiver
- Transaction history shows all operations
- Concurrent transactions work without interference
- Failed transactions are properly rolled back
- No "invalid transaction" errors for valid operations
- Balance updates reflected immediately on dashboard

### ❌ Should Prevent
- Withdrawals exceeding balance
- Transfers to non-existing accounts
- Negative or zero amounts
- Transfers to same account
- Partial transaction updates

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Database Connection**:
   - Verify MySQL is running
   - Check credentials in `DBConnection.java`
   - Ensure database `online_banking` exists

2. **Check Application Logs**:
   - Look for SQLException stack traces
   - Check for connection timeout errors
   - Verify transaction commit/rollback messages

3. **Verify Database Schema**:
   - Ensure all foreign key constraints are properly defined
   - Check that CHECK constraints allow valid operations
   - Verify column data types match Java types

4. **Clear Sessions**:
   - Logout and login again
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Restart Tomcat server

## Performance Considerations

The fix changes connection management from singleton to per-request connections. This is the correct approach for web applications but may have slight performance implications:

- **Before**: Single connection reused (unsafe)
- **After**: New connection per request (safe)

To optimize:
1. Consider implementing a connection pool (e.g., HikariCP, Apache DBCP)
2. Monitor connection creation/closure performance
3. Adjust database connection limits if needed

## Conclusion

The fix ensures proper transaction isolation and resource management, resolving the "invalid transaction" errors and ensuring balance updates work correctly. The changes follow JDBC best practices and ensure database integrity through proper connection handling.
