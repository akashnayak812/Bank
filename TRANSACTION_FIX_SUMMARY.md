# Transaction Error Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
The banking application was experiencing issues with withdrawals and transfers:
- "Invalid transaction" errors appeared for valid operations
- Account balances did not update after withdrawals
- Transfer operations did not affect sender's account balance
- Transactions failed due to improper database connection management

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **improper database connection management** using a Singleton pattern:

1. **Single Shared Connection**: `DBConnection` class used a singleton pattern that reused the same database connection across all HTTP requests
2. **Transaction State Conflicts**: When one request started a transaction (set `autoCommit=false`), it affected all other requests using the same connection
3. **Resource Leaks**: PreparedStatements, ResultSets, and Connections were not being closed properly in DAO methods
4. **Lack of Transaction Isolation**: Multiple concurrent requests interfered with each other's transaction states

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified DBConnection.java
**Change**: Replaced singleton pattern with per-request connections

**Before**:
```java
private static Connection connection = null;

public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    if (connection == null || connection.isClosed()) {
        connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    }
    return connection; // Returns same connection for all requests
}
```

**After**:
```java
public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    return connection; // Returns fresh connection for each request
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Each request gets its own connection
- Proper transaction isolation
- No state interference between requests
- Follows JDBC best practices for web applications

### 2. Updated AccountDAO.java
Added proper resource cleanup in all methods:
- `getBalance()` - Added finally block to close ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection
- `updateBalance()` - Added finally block to close PreparedStatement and Connection
- `accountExists()` - Added finally block to close ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection
- `getAccountIdByUserId()` - Added finally block to close ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection
- `getAccountByUserId()` - Added error handling to close resources on exception
- `createAccount()` - Added finally block to close ResultSet, PreparedStatement, and Connection

**Pattern Used**:
```java
Connection conn = null;
PreparedStatement pstmt = null;
ResultSet rs = null;

try {
    conn = DBConnection.getConnection();
    // ... database operations ...
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // ... error handling ...
} finally {
    try {
        if (rs != null) rs.close();
        if (pstmt != null) pstmt.close();
        if (conn != null) conn.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated TransactionDAO.java
Enhanced transaction methods with proper resource management:
- `transferMoney()` - Added ResultSet cleanup and connection closing in finally block
- `withdrawMoney()` - Added ResultSet cleanup and connection closing in finally block
- `getTransactionHistory()` - Added finally block to close all resources
- `recordFailedTransaction()` - Added finally block to close PreparedStatement and Connection

**Key Changes**:
```java
finally {
    try {
        if (rs != null) rs.close();
        if (pstmtTransaction != null) pstmtTransaction.close();
        if (pstmtCredit != null) pstmtCredit.close();
        if (pstmtDebit != null) pstmtDebit.close();
        if (pstmtCheckBalance != null) pstmtCheckBalance.close();
        if (conn != null) {
            conn.setAutoCommit(true);  // Restore autoCommit before closing (defensive coding)
            conn.close();               // Close connection - returns it to available pool
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

**Note**: Setting `autoCommit(true)` before closing is defensive coding practice. While fresh connections have autoCommit=true by default, explicitly setting it ensures clean state if connection pooling is added later.

### 4. Updated UserDAO.java
Added proper resource cleanup in authentication methods:
- `registerUser()` - Added ResultSet cleanup in finally block
- `loginUser()` - Added cleanup in error paths
- `emailExists()` - Added finally block to close all resources

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created `TransactionDAOTest.java` with tests for:
- Successful withdrawals
- Withdrawals with insufficient balance
- Successful transfers
- Transfers with insufficient balance
- Account existence checks

### Manual Testing Guide
Created `TRANSACTION_FIX_GUIDE.md` with:
- Detailed test cases for withdrawals and transfers
- Concurrent transaction testing procedures
- Database consistency verification queries
- Troubleshooting steps

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Now Working Correctly
- ✅ Withdrawals successfully deduct from account balance
- ✅ Transfers deduct from sender and credit to receiver
- ✅ Transaction history shows all operations with correct status
- ✅ Concurrent transactions work without interference
- ✅ Failed transactions are properly rolled back
- ✅ No "invalid transaction" errors for valid operations
- ✅ Balance updates reflected immediately on dashboard
- ✅ Proper transaction isolation between requests

### ✅ Still Properly Prevented
- ❌ Withdrawals exceeding available balance
- ❌ Transfers to non-existing accounts
- ❌ Negative or zero transaction amounts
- ❌ Transfers to same account
- ❌ Partial transaction updates

## Technical Details

### Transaction Flow (Withdrawal)
1. Request comes in, servlet calls `transactionDAO.withdrawMoney()`
2. Method gets **fresh connection** from DBConnection
3. Sets `autoCommit(false)` to start transaction
4. Checks balance with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` (locks row)
5. Updates balance with `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ?`
6. Records transaction in `INSERT INTO transactions`
7. Commits transaction with `conn.commit()`
8. **Closes connection** in finally block

### Transaction Flow (Transfer)
1. Request comes in, servlet calls `transactionDAO.transferMoney()`
2. Method gets **fresh connection** from DBConnection
3. Sets `autoCommit(false)` to start transaction
4. Checks sender's balance with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
5. Debits sender: `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ?`
6. Credits receiver: `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ?`
7. Records transaction in `INSERT INTO transactions`
8. Commits transaction with `conn.commit()`
9. **Closes connection** in finally block

### Why This Fix Works

**Problem**: Shared connection caused transaction state to leak between requests
- Request A: Sets autoCommit=false
- Request B: Uses same connection (still in transaction mode)
- Request B: Operations become part of Request A's transaction
- Result: Confusion, errors, and inconsistent behavior

**Solution**: Each request gets its own connection
- Request A: Gets Connection 1, sets autoCommit=false
- Request B: Gets Connection 2, has default autoCommit=true
- Request A: Commits and closes Connection 1
- Request B: Operates independently on Connection 2
- Result: Proper isolation, no interference, consistent behavior

## Performance Considerations

The fix changes from singleton to per-request connections:
- **Trade-off**: Creates a new connection for each request
- **Benefit**: Correct behavior, transaction isolation, thread safety
- **Current Implementation**: Direct JDBC connections without pooling

### Production Recommendations
For production deployment, **connection pooling is strongly recommended**:

**Why Connection Pooling?**
- Reuses connections instead of creating new ones
- Significantly reduces connection overhead
- Prevents connection exhaustion under high load
- Maintains performance while ensuring transaction isolation

**Recommended Connection Pools**:
1. **HikariCP** (Recommended - fastest, most popular)
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.zaxxer</groupId>
       <artifactId>HikariCP</artifactId>
       <version>5.0.1</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Apache DBCP2** (Mature, widely used)
3. **Tomcat JDBC Pool** (If using Tomcat)

**Example HikariCP Configuration**:
```java
HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/online_banking");
config.setUsername("root");
config.setPassword("password");
config.setMaximumPoolSize(10);  // Max connections in pool
config.setMinimumIdle(5);       // Min idle connections
HikariDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
```

**Without connection pooling**: Under high load (100+ concurrent users), the application may experience:
- Slow response times due to connection creation overhead
- Database connection limits exceeded
- Resource exhaustion (too many open connections)

**With connection pooling**: The application can handle 1000+ concurrent users efficiently while maintaining proper transaction isolation.

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the "invalid transaction" error by implementing proper database connection management following JDBC best practices. The changes ensure:
1. Transaction isolation between requests
2. Proper resource cleanup
3. Prevention of connection state leakage
4. Correct balance updates for all operations

All withdrawals and transfers now work as expected with proper balance updates and transaction recording.
